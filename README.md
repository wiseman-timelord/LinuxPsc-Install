# LinuxPsc-Install
Status: Un-Tested

### Description
I asked Gpt how to install Powershell Core on Ubuntu 24.10, it was unable to do this without snap package, so, I probed and found a alternate method using direct download of package from microsoft for Psc 7.x (latest), and it worked, so then made it into a script, this is that script. I have not tested it, because I already installed it, but wanted to keep something soes not to have issue next time. Here is that script.

### Requirements
- Ubutu, possibly works on other.

### Instructions
- Run the script from terminal, read output.
